						<br>
						<br>
						<p>My name is Sairam S. I am the youngest son of my late father who used to be known for south Indian classical vocal 
	  in the Indian Community (primarily from South Indian). I have attended Gaithersburg High School for 6 years. 
	  I started playing piano from 13 years old. But I started to play more consistently in classical when I was 15. Much later, 
	  I joined the high school chamber choir in the second semester of my eleventh grade and remained in it for the remainder of my high school years. 
	  On the first two years of being in the chamber choir, we performed at Morgan State University. In February of 2015, 
	  I participated in the Maryland Senior All-State Mixed Chorus of 2015 which took place in Baltimore. 
	  I had the prestigious honor of performing with the All-State Chorus at Morgan State University.ï»¿ 
	  I attended Montgomery College from 2015 to 2020 and have an AA degree in Computer Science. 
	  Shortly after, I attended University of Maryland Global Campus (University of Maryland University College) from 2020 to 2023 and received my B.S. degree in Computer Science.</p>
